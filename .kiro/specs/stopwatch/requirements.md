# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A simple stopwatch application built with minimal Python dependencies that incorporates dark humor into time tracking. The app will feature understated dark comedic elements while maintaining core stopwatch functionality including lap timing capabilities. Simplicity is paramount - the goal is to make time tracking mildly entertaining through dark humor without overcomplicating the interface or functionality.

## Requirements

3. WHEN lap times are particularly fast or slow THEN the system SHALL provide darkly humorous commentary
4. WHEN the user has been timing for extended periods THEN the system SHALL display darkly sarcastic messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on timing while enjoying the subtle comedic elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
